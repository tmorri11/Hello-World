        <p>
            I have been with Ford Credit for 25 years and have held a number of positions through my tenure.  I started as a Customer Service Representative in 1997 in Jackson, MS, and from there
            I moved to Pensacola, FL, Jacksonville, FL, St. Louis, MO and finally to Greenville, SC.  I moved to Greenville in 2007, and have been blessed with multiple opportunities in my time here
            working in Originations, Sales and Dealer Credit in various capacities.  My wife Diana and I have been married since 2004 and we have two children (Elle 16 and Jacob 14).

        <h3>Why I want to be a Software Engineer</h3>
        <p>
            I view the opportunity to learn to code is almost as important to the future success of Ford Credit as are the long-term relationships we have with our dealer body today,
            many of which I have been able to develop over my tenure with Ford Credit.  The value proposition we have always offered to our dealers is still ther, but it is clearly
            transitioning to a digital value proposition.  The importance of getting the transition done correctly and welcoming the change in making/developing the software products required
            for the future of Ford Credit can not be overstated in my opinion.  To have an opportunity to be a the ground floor for the digital upgrade of Ford Credit is very appealing and exciting
            to think I can be part of it.
