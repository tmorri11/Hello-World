        <p>
            This is my first self-designed webpage.  I'm learning on the fly.  This is not very easy.
            <br>
            I view the opportunity to learn to code is almost as important to the future success of Ford Credit as are the long-term relationships we have with our dealer body today,
            many of which I have been able to develop over my tenure with Ford Credit.  The value proposition we have always offered to our dealers is still ther, but it is clearly
            transitioning to a digital value proposition.  The importance of getting the transition done correctly and welcoming the change in making/developing the software products required
            for the future of Ford Credit can not be overstated in my opinion.  To have an opportunity to be a the ground floor for the digital upgrade of Ford Credit is very appealing and exciting
            to think I can be part of it.
