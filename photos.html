      <p> I like taking action picture of my kids playing sports.

            One of my favorite things to do is to take pictures of my kids playing sports and trying to get the action shot that without words can properly describe the moment and the effort that went into the play.
            I also like to take pictures of anything I see that is so beautiful, I want to be reminded of the moment at some point.

            The first picture below is a picture I took of my daughter playing soccer.  It was a very competitive game and I remember at the time when I took the picture the look on her face, really displayed the effort she was putting forward to try and win the game.
