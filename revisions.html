            I asked my wife and my daughter for feedback on my initial attempts at my website.  They were blunt in their feedback and indicated it was not the most appealing 
            site at first.  Initial feedback indicated they did not like the fact that my site had limited styling and no background.  The picture below shows how the site 
            looked as I was initially working on it.

            My daughter identified specific issues regarding the display of the page:      
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>                    
                    The picture of the family was not cropped well and did not flow well on the page.
                </li>
                <li>                   
                    The white background color seemed very generic and not very personalized.
                </li>
                <li>                    
                    The font throughout was Times New Roman which she thought should be updated to something more creative.  
                </li>
            <br>
        <p><i>The site looked significantly better after I was able to incorporate both of their feedback into my updated layout below:  </i></p>
