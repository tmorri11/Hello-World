            I asked my wife and my daughter for feedback on my initial attempts at my website.  They were blunt in their feedback and indicated it was not the most appealing site at first.
            Initial feedback indicated they did not like the fact that my site had limited styling and no background.  The picture below shows how the site looked as I was initially working on it.
        </p>    
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="First Look.jpg" width="1600" height="auto" />
            <br>
        <p>
            My daughter identified specific issues regarding the display of the page:      
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>                    
                    The picture of the family is too big for the page.
                </li>
                <li>                   
                    The heading was left-aligned and did not take advantage of all of the space on the page.
                </li>
                <li>                    
                    The font throughout was Times New Roman which she thought should be updated.  The font sizes were also too small.
                </li>
         <br>
            <p>
               The site looked significantly better after I was able to incorporate both of their feedback into my updated layout below:
            </p>
       
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
