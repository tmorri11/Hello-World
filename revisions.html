        <p>
            I have been with Ford Credit for 25 years and have held a number of positions through my tenure.  I started as a Customer Service Representative in 1997 in Jackson, MS, and from there
            I moved to Pensacola, FL, Jacksonville, FL, St. Louis, MO and finally to Greenville, SC.  I moved to Greenville in 2007, and have been blessed with multiple opportunities in my time here
            working in Originations, Sales and Dealer Credit in various capacities.  My wife Diana and I have been married since 2004 and we have two children Elle age 16 and Jacob age 14 (see picture below).
