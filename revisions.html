            I asked my wife and my daughter for feedback on my initial attempts at my website.  They were blunt in their feedback and indicated it was not the most appealing site at first.
            Initial feedback indicated they did not like the fact that my site had limited styling and no background.  The picture below shows how the site looked as I was initially working on it.
